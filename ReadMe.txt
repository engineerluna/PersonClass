Ceated a program that generats a list of people along with their first name, last name and their e-mail. It sorts them out to make it easier for the user to view the list of names in alphabetical order. 
Then implemented a method that would help the user find someone specifically by asking to input their first or last name. If the program finds the person the user is searching for it prints out their information (first, last name and e-mail)

Instead of asking the user to input names to populate the list, I tested the program with an array of size 10 that included names. Then asked user to input a name to serach for in the list.
